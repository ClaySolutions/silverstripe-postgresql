Requirements
-----------------------------------------------
- PostgreSQL 8.3.x or greater must be installed
- PostgreSQL <8.3.0 may work if T-Search is manually installed
- Known to work on OS X Leopard, Windows Server 2008 R2 and probably Linux

Documentation

Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------

Move the 'postgres' folder to the root level of the project.
You'll need to create a database with the desired name manually. 
Run dev/build and you should be set.

Usage Overview
-----------------------------------------------

See the documentation link for examples of PostgreSQL-specific functionality.

Known issues:
-----------------------------------------------

When you're setting this up for the first time, you will need to manually create the database 'SS_project' or whatever it's called.  
I haven't implemented the automatic database creation logic yet.

All column and table names must be double-quoted.  PostgreSQL automatically lower-cases columns, and your queries will fail if you don't.

Ts_vector columns are not automatically detected by the built-in search filters.  
That means if you're doing a search through the CMS on a ModelAdmin object, it will use LIKE queries which are very slow.  
If you're writing your own front-end search system, you can specify the columns to use for search purposes, and you get the full benefits of T-Search.

Most other modules probably don't work.  There are many instances of MySQL-compatible backticks '`' littering existing modules, 
and these need to be changed to double-quotes.  
There may also be instances of MySQL-specific SQL queries which will need to be made database-agnostic where possible.
